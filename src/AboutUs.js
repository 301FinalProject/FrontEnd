                <Card.Text>Hi, Iâ€™m Yvette Clapp.  I have a MBA in Finance and over 15 years of management experience and over 20 years of leadership experience. I recently completed courses in Data Analysis and Project Management.  I am currently attending DeltaV Coding School and am planning on completing all of the courses.
                  I have proven experience of leading teams through process changes successfully.  Many changes I have been involved in improved the SLAs of the department significantly.  Process efficiency is a passion for me.  This passion has generated many process changes that greatly reduces human error and an increase in SLA results.
                  My goal is to continually improve myself and most recently to reinvent myself into a career in website coding where I can utilize my passions to the benefit of the customer.

                <Card.Text>Hello, my name is Jaren Schnoebelen. I have been a student of DeltaV for about a year, and loving it so far. I chose to join DeltaV because I enjoy creating/building new things and I like working with computers. My favorite thing about coding and web development would have to be HTML and CSS. I feel pretty confident in making the web page look nice. I still need to work on my JavaScript skills, because I have the least amount of knowledge in that, but it will come with time. I also love music and sports. My favorite band is Pink Floyd, and my favorite sports team is the Chicago Cubs.

                <Card.Text>Joey is an aspiring software developer. Currently going through the Delta V Code School. After graduating from John F. Kennedy High School, he was looking for schooling that he could do that would give him the skills for the future without putting him into too much debt. After Delta V, Joey is looking forward to working with others to make websites as a full stack developer. Joey enjoys video games on his freetime and spending time with his friends playing card games like Magic The Gathering or playing Dungeons and Dragons. He also enjoys spending time at home to just chill and read a book or play animal crossing or stardew valley.
