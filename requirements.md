# requirements

To enhance the social gaming experience, and to make it easier to find people to game with. It gives you one platfrom to find an experience gamer to help you gain experience and get better at the game. We aren't built for specifically one game. We want to allow an easy access to a wide array of games rather than just one.

* Provide information on expreienced gamers that could help train.

* Able to see a list of experienced gamers that could train you. 

* See video game quotes. 

* You can sign in and save people to your page

* Our product will not have more than one game for now


Our MVP is to have halo show a list of players and their stats as well as allowing you to click on them to see a bit more information about them in a modal. We also want to be able to login even if it doesn't do anything. We also want the quotes.

Get more than one game in. Add people to your own list. Have a trainer sign in as well as a regular sign in.


A user can look at a list of players and click on them for more information. As well as sign in.

You land and login then are taken to a randomized quotes page. You can then click on the desired game on the nav bar to be taken to a player list for that game. You can then scroll through and click on players to see images of their clans and more info.



We want it to look nice while still being easy to use to satisfy our audience of gamers that like the black main with a bright color background color.

We don't want any broken links. Take it to a WIP page. Broken links make the page seem unprofessional even if it is not a full fledged site.
